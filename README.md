# ðŸš€ My Portfolio Website â€” Codefolio Showcase

Hi, Iâ€™m **Alaraaf Hassan** â€” a tech enthusiast and innovator. During this amazing event, I got the chance to build a personalized **portfolio website** that reflects my journey, skills, and startup ventures â€” all in a **modern card-style UI** using just HTML and CSS!

## ðŸ”¥ What I Built

- âœ¨ A sleek **black-yellow-tomato** themed website
- ðŸ§  Sectioned cards that share my:
  - Bio & interests
  - Startups like **Medora** and **Eat Wise**
  - Skills (Python, Web3, AI/ML, Firebase, Arduino)
  - Creative projects like **Chai Pe Charcha**
- âš¡ Simple, responsive, and lightweight â€” built without frameworks

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

- Importance of design consistency and color psychology
- How to structure content in an engaging, reader-friendly way
- Hands-on styling with **pure CSS** (cards, hover effects, fonts)

## ðŸ™Œ Special Thanks

To the organizers, mentors, and my peers for making this event such a collaborative and impactful experience!

**Stay building. Stay bold.**
